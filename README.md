papilio_scroller
================
Small design to scroll text ("test foobar.") over a 7 segment display. Works
with the Papilio One and LogicStart MegaWing.

The Makefile assumes WebPack and the Papilio loader to be installed. Use
`make write` to write the bit file to the FPGA or `make flash` to write it to
its flash memory.
